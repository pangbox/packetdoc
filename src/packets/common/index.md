# PangYa Common Data Structures
Many packets reuse the same structures of data, primarily when it comes to
communicating user information and equipment.

By maintaining these structures as separate definitions, when refinements can
be made to the understanding of these data, the change can be reflected in all
packet definitions where they occur.

## Data Structures
