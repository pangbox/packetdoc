  This packet contains the result of the Treasure Point mechanism that gives
  away items at the end of games.

  In matches, this will include all users' items mixed together (which allows the UI to show
  greyed-out items that have been awarded to other players). In tournaments, where every player
  has their own treasure point meter, only the local user's winnings are included.
  
  It is only sent when there is at least one item to award to someone.
  
  It is part of the response to:
  * [Event - Tournament / Match End](/events/match_end.md)

  **See Also:**
  * [GameService Server 0x0134 Treasure Point Winnings](/packets/gameservice/server/0134.ksy).
